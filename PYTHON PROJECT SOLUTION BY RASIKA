    "Data Integrity: The absence of outliers suggests the data is consistent and doesn’t contain extreme values that could skew any analysis. This could be \n",
    "useful when making predictions or building models, as it indicates that the dataset doesn't suffer from any extreme anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Focus on Central Tendency: With no extreme variations in the energy consumption, the focus can now shift to understanding the central tendency (mean,\n",

    "Modeling Considerations: The absence of outliers can also be beneficial for any subsequent modeling or analysis, as it reduces the need for data \n",
